# STPS-MTR
The implementation of "Multi-source transfer regression via source-target pairwise segment" in Matlab. 

Code for the Information Sciences publication. The full paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025520309804).
## Contribution

-The STPS-MTR method adaptively segments the different source domains and the target domain into different similar parts, each similar part can satisfy the condition that the distributions of the source domain and the target domain have an approximately linear relationship.
-The STPS-MTR method extracts the most similar part in different source domains as the knowledge transfer.


## Setup
